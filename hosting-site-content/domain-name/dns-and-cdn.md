# Configure DNS and CDN

## Why

In order to get my web site to be accessible with low latency by using my new domain name [www.brucelu.us](https://www.brucelu.us), I have to configure [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) name and [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network). 

## How

I chose [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) because it offers a free tier of DNS and CDN services. Yes, $0/month.

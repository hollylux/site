# Get a domain name

## What

Examples of domain name are: google.com, twitter.com etc..

## Why

To run my own web site with my favorite domain name, I have to get my own domain name.

## How

[Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) is the domain name provider where I purchased [my domain name](www.brucelu.us): brucelu.us

 First, go to [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) and search my favorite domain name brucelu.us see if it's taken or not. I'm lucky so I added my domain name to Cart and paid for the domain name. It looks like this:

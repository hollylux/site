# Create web site content

## What

It is what users see when they open my web site.

## How

There are really different ways to create web site content and host them. I use github to host my web site content because it provides a version control hosting environment and most importantly, it's free.

In order to do that, register GitHub then create repository under my account. It looks like this:

I create a testing web page in the root of my new repository, like this:

I also create a CNAME file in the root folder of my new repository. This allows my new domain name \(I'll get it later\) to work properly when it is redirected to my GitHub repository:

But GitHub repository only displays repository information. I'd like my content to be displayed as web pages. The answer is to use [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Refer to the following link to setup GitHub pages:

This is what I have:

Please remember this GitHub pages site. We'd use it later.

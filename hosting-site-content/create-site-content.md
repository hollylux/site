# Create web site content

## What

It is what users see when they open my web site.

## How

There are really different ways to create web site content and host them. I use github to host my web site content because it provides free version controlled hosting environment.

In order to do that, register [github](https://github.com/) first then create repository under my account. It looks like this:

But GitHub repository only displays repository information. I'd like my content to be displayed as web pages. The answer is to use [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Refer to the following link to setup GitHub pages:

This is what I have:

Please remember this GitHub pages site. We'd use it later.
